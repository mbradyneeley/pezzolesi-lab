### Overview
Chris Simeone is a fourth-year graduate student in the Department of Human Genetics investigating the role of genetic variation underlying de novo sphingolipid genes in metabolic disease. Currently, Chrisâ€™ projects focus on understanding rare variation in these genes within cohorts of patients with diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and common variation for circulating sphingolipid profiles in patients. Prior to his graduate education, Chris worked at the Joslin Diabetes Center in the laboratory of Andrzej Krolewski, MD, PhD, where he focused on identifying novel protein biomarkers in patients with DKD.
