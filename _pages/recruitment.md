## Post-Doctoral Research Fellow

We're looking for a talented post-doctoral research fellow to join our group!  If you're interested in discovering and studying the effects of high-impact risk variants for diabetes and diabetic kidney disease, please reach out (grant funded).

## Bioinformatics Data Analyst

The Pezzolesi lab is seeking a bioinformatics data analyst to assist in analyzing high-throughput genetic data as part of several research projects that aim to investigate the basis of diabetes, diabetes-related complications, and chronic kidney disease using molecular biology, next-generation sequencing technology, and bioinformatics. The bioinformatics data analyst will be responsible for working independently, as well as part of a team, performing advanced genetic analysis (e.g., using GWAS and NGS analytical methods), and evaluating and reporting the results of these analyses. The bioinformatics data analyst will assist in the development and implementation of analytical workflows, evaluating data quality, analyzing data, validating results, and seeking ways to improve the analytical workflows. The bioinformatics data analyst may also assist in collecting and analyzing data, some of which may be obtained from retrospective medical record data or surveys.
